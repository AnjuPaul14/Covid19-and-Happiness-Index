# Covid19-and-Happiness-Index

In this project i am going to work with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University,
which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.
Also I have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
I am going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country 
and how happy people are, living in that country.
